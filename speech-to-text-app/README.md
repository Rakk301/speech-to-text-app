# Swift Components for Speech-to-Text App

This directory contains the Swift components for the macOS speech-to-text application.

## üìÅ File Structure

- **SpeechToTextApp.swift** - Main app coordinator and lifecycle management
- **AudioRecorder.swift** - AVAudioEngine wrapper for microphone recording
- **HotkeyManager.swift** - Global hotkey registration (‚åò‚áßS)
- **PasteManager.swift** - Clipboard operations and cursor positioning
- **PythonBridge.swift** - Subprocess communication with Python scripts
- **Logger.swift** - Timestamped logging system
- **Info.plist** - App configuration and permissions

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The app follows a component-based architecture where each Swift file has a single responsibility:

1. **SpeechToTextApp** coordinates all components and manages the app lifecycle
2. **AudioRecorder** handles microphone recording with Whisper-compatible settings
3. **HotkeyManager** registers and handles the global hotkey
4. **PasteManager** manages clipboard operations and text insertion
5. **PythonBridge** executes Python scripts for ML processing
6. **Logger** provides timestamped logging for debugging

## üîß Building the Project

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 13+ 
- macOS 12.0+
- Python 3.8+ with required dependencies

### Setup
1. Create a new Xcode project (macOS App)
2. Add all Swift files to the project
3. Add the Info.plist file
4. Configure build settings:
   - Set deployment target to macOS 12.0+
   - Enable App Sandbox (optional)
   - Add required frameworks:
     - AVFoundation
     - Carbon
     - AppKit
     - Foundation

### Required Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:
- **Microphone** - For audio recording
- **Accessibility** - For global hotkeys and cursor positioning
- **Apple Events** - For controlling other apps to paste text

### Dependencies
- **AVFoundation** - Audio recording and playback
- **Carbon** - Global hotkey management
- **AppKit** - macOS UI components
- **Foundation** - Basic functionality

## üöÄ Usage

1. Build and run the app
2. Grant microphone and accessibility permissions when prompted
3. Press ‚åò‚áßS to start recording
4. Speak into the microphone
5. Press ‚åò‚áßS again to stop recording
6. The transcribed text will be pasted at the cursor position

## üîç Debugging

The app includes comprehensive logging:
- Check the log file in `~/Documents/Logs/transcriptions.log`
- Console output for real-time debugging
- Error handling with user-friendly alerts

## üìù Notes

- Audio is recorded at 16kHz mono for optimal Whisper compatibility
- Temporary audio files are automatically cleaned up
- The app runs as a menu bar application (LSUIElement = true)
- Global hotkey requires accessibility permissions
- Python scripts should be placed in the `Python/` directory relative to the app bundle

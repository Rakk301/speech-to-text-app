# Xcode Project Structure & File Management Rule

## Project Structure
- Xcode project file (`SpeechToTextApp.xcodeproj`) is in the project root.
- All Swift source files are in the `Swift/` directory.
- Python scripts are in the `Python/` directory.
- Configuration files are in the `Config/` directory.
- No unnecessary nesting; each language/component is organized by folder.

## Adding Files
- Add new Swift files to the `Swift/` directory.
- In Xcode: File → Add Files to "SpeechToTextApp"…
  - Select files from `Swift/`, choose "Reference file in place", and check the app target.
- Add config or Python directories as folder references (blue folder) for visibility and management.
- Reference config files in place; access them in Swift using relative paths.

## Project Management
- Always check target membership when adding files.
- Use `.gitignore` to ignore user-specific Xcode files (`xcuserdata/`), but keep project files (e.g., `project.pbxproj`) in version control.
- Let Xcode manage `Info.plist` and entitlements automatically via the UI.

## Capabilities & Permissions
- Use the Signing & Capabilities tab to add App Sandbox, Microphone, and other permissions.
- Xcode will create/update the entitlements file as needed.

## Build & Run (Xcode Only)
- Use Xcode's built-in tools
- Use ⌘B to build, ⌘R to run
- Use Xcode's debugger, console, and UI previews for development
- Use Product → Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K) to clean builds
- Use Product → Build For → Running to build for specific destinations

| Task                        | How to Do It in Xcode                                 |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Add Swift file              | File → Add Files… → Reference in place, check target  |
| Add config/Python directory | File → Add Files… → Reference in place (blue folder)  |
| Add capability/permission   | Signing & Capabilities tab                            |
| Manage Info.plist/entitlements | Let Xcode handle automatically                     |
| Ignore user-specific files  | Use `.gitignore` for `xcuserdata/`                    |

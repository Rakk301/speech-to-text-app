# macOS Platform Rule
This project is a **macOS-only app**. When making suggestions about frameworks, libraries, or APIs, always recommend those that are specific to or best supported on macOS (e.g., AppKit, AVFoundation, Carbon, NSPasteboard, etc.). Avoid cross-platform or non-macOS solutions unless explicitly requested.
